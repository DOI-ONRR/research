# Study Plan & Interview Guide 

## Goals

The goals of the tree test are to:

* Validate the structure that came out of card sorting  
* Determine whether users can find items that were hard to categorize in the card sort 
* Determine if there are labeling tweaks needed in the categories 
* Get feedback on the latest homepage wireframe 

## Recruiting plan
We will reach out to external industry users (capped at 9 participants) and internal ONRR users.

## Study logistics

We will use a clickable Axure prototype with the categories and wireframe. 

### Tasks
These will be presented on the screen in the Axure prototype. 
1. You are a new reporter and want to get set up to start submitting reports to ONRR. 
2. You are having trouble logging into Data Warehouse and want to get help finding out what you should do. 
3. You need to report production. 
4. You need to find a lease number to put on your royalty report. 
5. You need to look something up in the handbook for oil royalty reporting. 
6. You want to find the ONRR representative assigned to your company to contact with questions. 
7. You have a new person on your team and need to fill out the form for them to be an official contact (Addressee of Record Designation for Service of Official Correspondence Form - ONRR-4444) . 
8. You need to make a rent payment. 
9. You need to read a regulation to value a commodity on your report. 
10. You received an order to pay from ONRR and you would like to file an appeal.  

### Intro

Introduction: Thank you for taking the time to participate in our research study. My name is [facilitator name] and I will be conducting the interview [and my teammates will be listening in to take notes and observe].

External users: Did {Maroya or Lindsay} send you the consent form to sign? It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information  

Our team’s goal is to understand how people use our site and the questions they expect our site to be able to answer. 

There are no right or wrong answers and you won’t hurt my feelings.

Do what you would do if we weren’t here.  

Think out loud.

### About tree testing
On onrr.gov, one of our biggest challenges is organizing information, so that it is easy to find. This is where you come in. We are so familiar with the product that the way we might associate terms is not the way a user would.   

I’ll give you a link to page with the categories we want to put on our website and I’ll have you navigate the category tree to tell me where you would look for a series of items.   

I also want to stress that this isn’t a test and we certainly ARE NOT TESTING YOU.  There are no right or wrong answers, and please know that nothing you say will make me happy and nothing you say will upset me. 

### Instructions

1. Direct each participant to the correct link 

[Version 1](https://wkvlqa.axshare.com/version_1.html)
[Version 2](https://wkvlqa.axshare.com/version_2.html)
[Version 3](https://wkvlqa.axshare.com/version_3.html)

2. Read each item to find on the right and then use the categories on the left to find the item. 

### Follow-up questions 
* Tell me a little bit about how it felt to navigate the categories. 
* Was anything you use onrr.gov for missing from the tasks?  Where would you look for that? 
* Were there any tasks that were difficult to find where to look? 
* Were there any categories or subcategories you would change the wording on? 

## Homepage Wireframe 

Here’s a visual of the end goal organization of the website. Not everything is clickable because this is a prototype, but it will give to an idea of how the categories could be applied to the website.

Take a look and let me know what you think about what you see here. 

Does it make sense? 

Which parts of the page would you use? 

Are there things you would remove? 

### Close 

* Are you interested in participating in future studies?  
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with? 
* Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve our site. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
