# Plan
We tested onrr.gov and a home page prototype  with existing external and internal users.    

## Goals
Understand what questions users have when visiting the site.
Understand whether different user types have different questions.
Understand what problems the users have with the current site.
Test out a simplified homepage prototype to find out what areas of the site are of highest values to the users.​
Test out a simplified reporting tab prototype to find out how users prioritize resources.



## Test Method and Desired Participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview participants from each of the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on people who actually use the site because they will have real questions that they look for the site to answer.
* User Type 1: Operator (Reporter)
* User Type 2: Payor
* User Type 3: Production (Internal)  
* User Type 4: Royalty (Internal)
* User Type 5: Compliance (Internal)

## Recruitment Strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who we either know or suspect have used our site. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.

## Test Assets

We will show them the current onrr.gov, a homepage prototype and a reporting prototype.
