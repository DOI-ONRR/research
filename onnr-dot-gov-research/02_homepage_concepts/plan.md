# Plan
We want to make sure our product vision is valid and reflects actual user needs.   

## Goals
Understand what questions users have when visiting the site.
Understand whether different user types have different questions.
Understand what problems the users have with the current site.



## Test Method and Desired Participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview at least 4 participants from each of the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on people who actually use the site because they will have real questions that they look for the site to answer.
* User Type 1: Operator (Reporter)
* User Type 2: Payor
* User Type 3: Production (Internal)  
* User Type 4: Royalty (Internal)
* User Type 5: Compliance (Internal)

## Recruitment Strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who we either know or suspect have used our site. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.

## Test Assets

We will primarily be asking questions, but if we have time at the end, we will show them the current onrr.gov.
