# Study Plan & Interview Guide 

## Goals 

The goals of the card sort are to: 

* Understand how users think about onrr.gov content 
* Understand how users organize the content 

## Recruiting plan 
We will reach out to external industry users (capped at 9 participants) and internal ONRR users. 

## Study logistics 

We will use GitHub projects for the participants to sort the cards.  We will run the sessions live because we have to give users a code during login to prevent PII from being attached to their organization.  We will also use the opportunity to ask follow-up questions to understand why the participant sorted the content the way they sorted it.  We will be able to conduct the sessions with one facilitator and won’t need note takers because we’ll have the participant’s organization in GitHub. 

## Interview Guide
### Intro 

Introduction: Thank you for taking the time to participate in our research study. My name is [facilitator name] and I will be conducting the interview [and my teammates will be listening in to take notes and observe]. 

External users: Did {Maroya or Lindsay} send you the consent form to sign? It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information  

Our team’s goal is to understand how people use our site and the questions they expect our site to be able to answer.  

There are no right or wrong answers and you won’t hurt my feelings. 

Do what you would do if we weren’t here.  

Think out loud. 

### About card sorting 

On onrr.gov, one of our biggest challenges is organizing information, so that it is easy to find. This is where you come in. We are so familiar with the product that the way we might associate terms is not the way a user would.   

I’ll give you a link to a “stack” of cards with terms on them and I would like you to separate those cards into groups that make sense to you.  For example, suppose I gave you a stack of cards with the 50 states written on them.  You might decide to organize them:
* Geographically- “New England, Southern, Western, Mid-west, etc.” 
* States you’ve visited versus states you haven’t- maybe you’d even add a group for states you haven’t visited but want to. 
* By climate or weather 
* By time zone 

Whatever makes the most sense to you!  So you’ll need to review the terms on the cards and decide which organization makes the most sense.   

I also want to stress that this isn’t a test and we certainly ARE NOT TESTING YOU.  There are no right or wrong answers, and please know that nothing you say will make me happy and nothing you say will upset me. 

### Instructions

#### As you sort 

* Think out loud, so I can understand your thought process. 
* Let me know if there are any cards you don’t understand. 
* When you’re done I’ll have a few follow-up questions for you. 

### Follow-up questions 

* Tell me a little bit about how you organized the information. 
* What do you typically use onrr.gov to do? 
* Was anything you use it for missing from the cards? 
* Were there any cards that were difficult to find a home for? 
* Were there any cards you would change the wording on? 
* Were there any you would put in more than one place? 

### Close 

* Are you interested in participating in future studies?  
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with? 

Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve our site. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
