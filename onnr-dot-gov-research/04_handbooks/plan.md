# Study Plan & Interview Guide 
## Background 

We have recently re-designed the structure of the Minerals Revenue Reporter Handbook to be more user friendly by adding a searchable table feature for the table of contents, chapters, supplemental information, and contact information. We would like to test the new design with users and receive feedback for improvements before re-designing the structure of the other handbooks.

## Goals 

* Understand if the searchable table improves navigation  
* Understand if users are able to perform tasks easily with the new design.  
* Understand if we should implement the new design to other handbooks.  

## Method and Desired Participants 

Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview at least 9 participants from  the following user group for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on people who actually use the site because they will have real questions that they look for the site to answer. 
* User Type: Royalty Reporter/Payor 

## Recruiting plan 
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people from industry. We will recruit people that we know have used the revenue handbook previously.  We will ask for recommendations from our internal Reference and Reporting Management (RRM) team.   

## Test Assets 
We will give them task-based questions, and if we have time, show them the structure of other handbooks.
