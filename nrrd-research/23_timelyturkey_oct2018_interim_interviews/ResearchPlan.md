# Background
We have a few users who have expressed intereste in user research, so we're going to interview them about their processes and have them review the latest designs.
# Goals
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
* Probe into the following, as is applicable to the user: lease level data, monthly data, printing, sales year data, long-term trend analysis, withheld data, production rankings
* Get feedback on the latest designs that are relevant to the user's work flows.  (latest prototype of home page and Explore Data pages, withheld design, probe into Revenue page descriptions and page order)


# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of a couple weeks, we’d like to speak with 3-5 individuals from several of the following user groups for 30 minute to 1 hour remote 1:1 interviews.  
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
# Recruitment strategy
We will be talking with users who we've previously been in contact with who have expressed an interest in participating in research.
