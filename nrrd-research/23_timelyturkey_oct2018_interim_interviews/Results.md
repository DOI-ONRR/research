# Task Flows
* One participant mostly deals with production data in his work, but found the revenue and disbursements on our site interesting. He usually uses data to respond to ad hoc requests for reports.
* One participant writes about oil and coal both on and offshore focused on production and revenue.
* One participant answers question for people internal to her organization, primarily focused on coal. She mostly makes spreadsheets, but occasionally does charts. The data often gets dropped into reports.

# Update Frequency
* One participant wants our data updated more frequently.

# Lease Level Data
* The two participants asked about lease level data want it.  One participant wants well level data, as well.  One participant wants to see company/operator level data rolled up from lease level data.

# Monthly Data
* All participants think monthly data is useful.  Mostly to see how the current year is going to far, which requires being able to compare against how it compares to the prior year.
* It would be useful to have it by state and as back as far as possible.
* Monthly data needs to be updated frequently to be useful.

# Printing
* Two participants wouldn't print because they get their data digitally.
* One participant prints things out, so she can refer to them later.  Also makes screenshots of data she wants to refer back to and drops them in a doc.

# Sales Year Data
* Sales year data isn't as useful.  One participant thinks sales year data might be interesting, one doesn't care at all, and one said she doesn't get asked about it much.

# Trend Analysis
* All participants want the data to go back as far as possible for all time to get at what’s going on now compared to previously.

# Withheld Data
* The one participant who saw the withheld data design didn't understand it.  

# Production Rankings
* Participants would use rankings to compare against other data.  One said they expected them to be wrong because EIA updates their data more frequently. One would compare against data from the states and one wants to compare changes over time.

# Revenue
* One participant was confused by the Revenue by Phase graphic.  After seeing the phase about leasing, said he wanted the lease sale information as a list of companies who have bought leases.
* Revenue by Company was the most interesting to one participant.  He wanted to be able to drill into the companies to see what commodities they have and to be able to filter by multiple commodities.
* One participant wants to see revenue by commodity for each state.

# Data Formats
* One participant doesn't want to use pivot tables.
* One participant would like to be able to create charts from the site, since their graphics people won't create them.
* One participant mostly wants the downloads to find the details and thinks downloads are sufficient for historical data.

# Homepage
* One participant wants to see the numbers on the charts.

# Explore Data
* One participant thinks of commodities as “sources”.  Thinks “origin” would be better for what we’re calling source.
* One participant wants the Production summary graphics to be interactive.

# Other Findings
* One participant doesn’t think we should have EIA data on our site.
* One participant wants commodity data for everything.
* One participant used the stats page in the past and has had to request data we no longer have on the site that was on the stats page.
