# Study Plan

## Background 

We have launched a new site that includes a new Explore Data page and an updated query tool.  The Explore Data page includes a new interactive map for revenue, production and disbursements, summary and detail cards at the national, state and county levels, as well as summary and detail charts.  

We also have updated the data query tool to be able to query data by production, revenue, and disbursements and the ability to group by land type, state/offshore region, county, revenue type, commodity, disbursement source, recipient.  You can query data by fiscal or calendar year.  You can also download data in either excel or csv files. 

We will also have launched a new dataset – revenue by company – in both the Explore Data page and query tool before this study.  We want to evaluate the usability of the implementation of that dataset. 

We want to observe how users navigate the new site and document any usability issues. 

## Goals  

* Determine whether the new explore data page meets user needs. 

* Determine whether the data query tool meets user needs. 

* Determine whether the implementation of revenue by company meets user needs. 

* Identify areas of the new site and bugs that need to be fixed.  

* Get feedback on the new header designs. 

## Method and Desired Participants 

Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview at least 8 participants from the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on users that have oil and gas experience and understand natural resources data. 

Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions. 

Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind. 

Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people. 

Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system. 

## Recruitment Strategy: 

In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who are familiar with the site or oil and gas revenue data. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.  

We are hoping to speak with users who are familiar with our data and can help evaluate if the data organization makes sense.  

## Test Assets: 

Live site: https://revenuedata.doi.gov/ 

PR with new header and chart colors: https://950-siteheader.app.cloud.gov/

## Interview testing Process: 

We’re testing the design we’re not testing you. 

There are no right or wrong answers.  

Please think out loud as we are conducting the interview for us to understand your thought process as you are exploring the site.  We want to know what you would do if we weren’t watching. 

We appreciate your honest feedback to help us improve our designs. 

## Tasks & Questions: 
### Homepage  
Start at the Home page: https://950-siteheader.app.cloud.gov/ 
User Directed Task 
* Can you tell me a specific question you have about natural resources revenue? How would you find that information using this website? 
Follow-up questions:

Probes if they don’t find them naturally: 
* How would you find information for your state?

### Logo Designs 
Here are some ideas we’re looking at for updates to our logo.

Are you interested in participating in future studies? 

Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with to get more insight on this website? 

Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve processes around sharing disbursements data. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
