# Background
We have created a production filterable table to be able to sort our annual and monthly production using various relevant filters. The annual table will list all the commodities, and the monthly table will only list the highest producing commodities. These will serve as a home for lease level data once it is available.  We want to evaluate these designs with users.

# Goals
* Determine how the users would use this table as a part of their overall task
* Determine the best approach for filterable production tables on the page.
* Determine the best approach to display trends (bars or sparkline)
* Determine the best categories to be listed under “organized by” and “sort by” columns
* Determine the best language to use for “land owner” column (Federal, Native American, Mixed), source, commodity column, and any other language on the pages.
* Determine how table should be sorted. 
* Determine if volume is needed by users. 
* Determine best hook for lease level data.

# Method and Desired Participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to to interview at least 5 participants from the following user groups for 30 minutes 1:1 interviews. We will focus on users that have oil and gas experience and understand production data and different commodity units.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.

# Recruitment Strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who are familiar with the site or oil and gas production data. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally. 

We are hoping to speak with ONRR employees who are familiar with our data and can help evaluate if the data organization makes sense. We would also like to speak with company representatives who are responsible for production reporting. We are reaching out to ONRR production team to get referrals. We will also use social media and outreach events to recruit participants.

# Test Assets
We will be testing the link on the Explore Data page that takes the user to the filterable tables and lease level data to understand if users understand the link’s purpose and if placement is intuitive. 

We will be testing the following
* Explore Data page with links to filterable table
* Yearly production, monthly production
* Search leases and agreements
* Monthly filterable table
* Term Source
* Sort by & Organize by
* Trend helpful?
* Yearly filterable table
* Commodity level (oil)
* State level (California )
* State and Commodity ( California oil)
* Yearly bars



# Interview Guide

## Intro
### Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to participate in our research study. I will be conducting the interview, and my teammates will be listening in to take notes and observe.
Our goal in this team is to talk to users about our site, test how they would complete a task,  and observe how they are using it to learn about possible improvements to the site. 
### External users
I have a form for you to digitally sign giving us permission to conduct the study. It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information


## User Task Background (people don’t fit our user profiles) (5 min)
Tell us a little bit about your background, so we can get a sense for where your perspective is coming from.

## User Task Background (people who fit our user profiles) (20 min)
* What is your role and how do you use natural resources data in that role?
* Have you used the Natural Resource Revenue site before?
* Can you walk us through how you would find the data, analysis you would perform on the data, and how you would use or present this data?
* Is production data by lease and agreement important to you? 
  - Where do they fit in the process?
  - Which specific pieces of information do you need?
  - How do you currently access the production data you need to do your job?
  - How can the portal help facilitate that process?
  - Is there a geographic component to how you want to use that data?
  - In what format would you like to see monthly production data?
  - How would you like to search for the data (e.g. by lease or agreement number in a database, on a map)
 * What kind of questions do you get from other people about production, particularly at the lease level?

## Interview testing Process:
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* There are no right or wrong answers. 
* Please think out loud as we are conducting the interview for us to understand your thought process as you are exploring the site.  We want to know what you would do if we weren’t watching.
* We are testing the design and different prototypes and not everything may be clickable.
* We appreciate your honest feedback to help us improve our designs

## Tasks & Questions:
* Can you tell me a specific task you would use the data for? Can you walk me through how you would find that information?
  - Take a look at this page and tell me what this site is about.
  - What do you think of the information that’s presented?
  - Is this information useful?
  - Is there any information that you would like to add to the table? 
  - Poke around and see if you can learn more about the site.
* Complete the task identified in the previous task, if possible.
  - If you wanted to know how much oil was produced in 2014, how would you get there? 
  - Is that where you thought it would be? Did the placement make sense? 
  - How many years back do you want to see data?  What do you use historical data for?
    - Is it helpful to see the ten year trend?
    - Do you need all the numbers in the table?
    - How many years should show in the table by default?
  - What does the “land owner” column tell you?
    - How would you abbreviate “Federal” “Native American” and “Mixed”?
    - What does “Mixed” mean to you for land ownership?

* Sparkline styling. Take user back to “Yearly” Data to show sparklines
  - What do sparklines show? 
  - Then show Yearly Bars. What do bars show? 
  - Which is more helpful? 
* Do you know what a well number is?
  - If yes,  if you had a well number, how would you find out how much production was on that well?
