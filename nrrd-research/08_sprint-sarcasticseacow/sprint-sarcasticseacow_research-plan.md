# Sprint-SarcasticSeacow research plan

## Goals
For this round of research, we're zooming back out to a more general level of inquiry. We want insight into how people feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system so that we can understand how USEITI might fit into their already-existing mental models. We will be conducting interviews with participants in the states and counties that USEITI has identified as focus areas.


## Background

This sprint is a continuation of our [HaughtyHagfish sprint](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/06_sprint-hautyhagfish/sprint-hautyhagfish_research-plan.md). It turned out that recruiting the right people to talk to took much longer than expected and so we didn't have enough data at the end of that original sprint to make any conclusions. Now, we've talked to enough of that match our intended audiences, in particular the journalist persona type, to be able to draw some insight into whether our site is meeting their needs or not. This will influence which features we choose to prioritize in the future.


## Methods
* 30 min interviews with people unfamiliar with USEITI who live in USEITI focus states and counties and meet one of the persona types we identified before we started building the site.
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote
