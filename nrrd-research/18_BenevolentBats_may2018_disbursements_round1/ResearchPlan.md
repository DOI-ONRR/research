# Goals

| Goals | Questions |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Determine whether we have addressed issues identified during last round of research. | Can users get to the specific data they want using any of the designs? |
| Determine the best approach to presenting disbursements data.| Are tables useful?|
| | Are filters useful? |
| | Are charts useful?|
| | Is commodity data useful?|
| | What do users like/don’t like about a specific piece of a design?|
| | Do users want any of the other functions like download, email, and save?|

# Test Method 
Over the course of the sprint we’d like to speak with individuals for 30-minute remote 1:1 interviews to have participants walk us through the prototypes for the design options and talk with them about how they would use each and their preference.
Prototype: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_page.html

We will alternate the order the designs are presented to avoid bias due to the order in which the prototypes are presented.  After participants have gone through all 3 (or 4 if we have time) designs, we will have them select their preferred option and probe into the functionality that the liked or didn't like across options.

# What to test? 
We will test the flow for understanding disbursements data and getting to one number by having participants articulate a task they commonly do using disbursement data and talking us through how they would use each design to conduct that task.

## Comprehension: understanding the data
* Do users understand the data that’s available?
* Are they able to get to the story they need to tell?
## Comfort: are people okay with the information we’re providing 
* Is there missing data?
* Are we providing the data in a format the user is comfortable with?
## Capability: can people get to a single number?
* Is there data they want to be able to filter by that we’re not providing?
* What is the minimum amount of filtering they want to be able to do?

# Recruitment strategy:

Since we already talked with target users prior to the design studio, we're going to start by reaching out to the participants from that study to see if we've addressed their concerns and reach out to other users in the participant pipeline (that have been previously identified) if we need additional participants.  We're aiming for 5-9 participants, both internal and external to DOI.
