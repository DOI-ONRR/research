# Study Guide

## Intro
* Qituwra/Ben (if present): Introduce Shannon
* Welcome, thank you for taking the time to meet with us.  We’re looking for feedback on some designs we’ve been working on.
* I’m here today along with a few people who are taking notes.  I have a form for you to digitally sign giving us permission to conduct the study. It just states that it won't be capturing any personally identifiable information 
  * Consent form: [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenUo9tqJx7vCoM0egah927IkJO5WEQIEBckXgrOaGOxUjLqg/viewform)
## Background Info
* Tell me a little bit about what you use the NRRD Portal for.
* Do you use the data about disbursements (how ONRR distributes the money that comes in)? If so, how do you use disbursement data.
## About testing a prototype
* We’re going to be testing a prototype of a few ways to look at disbursements data.  Because it’s a prototype, not everything will be clickable.  It’s only built to complete a few tasks to get a feel for how the design would work.
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* I want to know what you really think and how you would actually use it.  You can’t hurt my feelings. We want honest feedback so we can make the designs better. 
* Prototype: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_page.html
Rotate the order for showing drillable table (Option A), top filters (Option B), and chart (Option C). 
P1: A, B, C
P2: B, A, C
P3: C, B, A
P4: A, C, B
P5: B, C, A
P6: C, A, B
P7: A, B, C
Only show wizard (Option D) if there is enough time at the end.

* We’ve sent you a link to the prototype.  Will you please open the link and share your screen with me?  (link in bottom right of screen.)


## Tasks
* Start by clicking on the [Option #] button at the top of the page.
  * Take a look at this first screen and tell me a little about what you are seeing.
    * What can you do from this page?
  * What is a common task that you would try to complete using disbursements data? [On subsequent options, ground to the task they articulated for the first one.]
    * Without clicking on anything, talk me through what you would do on this page to complete that task.
  * If they can’t come up with a task or need to click through to understand how things work:
    * Imagine you are interested in data for Texas, how would you get to that data?
      * Probe into how they are accessing the information.
    * Now imagine you heard about the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA), which entitles Texas to a share of revenue coming from offshore sources in the Gulf of Mexico and you want to know how much money Texas received from this act.  How would you find that?
      * Probe into how they are accessing the information.
    * What would you do if you wanted to find data just for oil?
      * Probe into how they are accessing the information.
  * What do you think about how this information is presented?
    * What could make it better?
    * Is there anything missing?
    * Anything that gets in your way?
  * Repeat for remaining options.
* After all options are presented:
  * Which option do you prefer? Why?
    * If they don’t pick, ask them to rank them.
  * Are there pieces of any of the other options you would keep?
  * What do you think of the following features?  Would you use them?
    * Download
    * Email
    * Save
    * Comparing year over year
    * Monthly data
    * Commodity data


## Close
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with to get more insight on disbursements data?
* Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve processes around sharing disbursements data. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
