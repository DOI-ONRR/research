# Sprint-CumberbatchofCookies research plan


## Goals & questions

Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate prototype state pages | Do people understand key concepts (like federal revenue) more quickly in this context?
 | Do people understand the county map breakdown interactions? ie, that you can change years? 
 | Do people understand what data they're seeing on the state pages?
 | Can people find data that's relevant to their area (region or county)?
 | Do people understand the direction money is moving? Who is making the money-- 'revenue' to company or government.
 | Do people understand how to move between the national and state views?


## Background

Over the past few sprints, we've created state profile pages, which hopefully address some of the big issues raised by earlier research, including...

* [Confusion about revenues](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/1260)
* [Desire for more local stories/data](https://github.com/ONRR/research/blob/master/nrrd-research/10_sprint-elegantechidna/sprint-elegantechidna_research-plan.md#how-do-journalists-decide-if-something-is-interesting-and-worth-writing-about)
* [Preferences for consolidated information about single states](https://github.com/ONRR/research/blob/master/nrrd-research/10_sprint-elegantechidna/sprint-elegantechidna_research-plan.md#how-do-people-want-to-use-our-data-what-were-they-trying-to-do-and-what-did-they-expect)
* [The general need for data and context to be pulled together across the site](https://github.com/ONRR/research/blob/master/nrrd-research/10_sprint-elegantechidna/sprint-elegantechidna_research-plan.md#linking-related-information-and-data-across-the-site)

These pages are still in prototype form, but are getting much better feedback in terms clearly addressing core user needs. Let's show them to more people to make sure we're still moving in the right direction.

## Methods

* 3-5 30 min interviews with people unfamiliar with the USEITI site
* Notes, no recording
* In-person or remote
