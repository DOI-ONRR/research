# User tasks
* Find a specific number for a known well or contract.
* Explore wells in a given geographic area.
# Search fields
* Users want to be able to search by well API number, contract number, operator number, and operator name.
* They also want to be able to search by well location using a map.
# Display fields
* Users want as much detail as we can give them.
# Offshore planning area
* The users who do use the offshore planning area currently seem to think lease and well level data would supersede the need for it.  They use it because itâ€™s currently the most detailed thing we have.
