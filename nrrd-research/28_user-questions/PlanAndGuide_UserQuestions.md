# Plan
We want to make sure our product vision and sample scenarios for each user type are valid and reflect actual user needs.

## Goals
* Understand what questions users have coming to the site.
* Understand whether different user types have different questions.
* Get feedback on homepage and filterable table designs. (if we have spare time)

## Method and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like  to interview at least 4 participants from each of the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on people who actually use the site because they will have real questions that they look for the site to answer.

* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.

## Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who we either know or suspect have used our site. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.

## Test assets
We will primarily be asking questions, but if we have time at the end, we will show them our new homepage and filterable table designs.
