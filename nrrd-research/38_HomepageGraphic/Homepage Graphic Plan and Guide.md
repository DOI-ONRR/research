# Plan
What are we testing: Homepage Graphic

Tasks: What do we want from this study?
1. Users understand the purpose of the site
1. Identify potential improvements for the homepage graphic(s)

Goal: Determine which aspects of the two homepage graphic options work and don't work for users and to test the how datasets fit diagram now that it's built.

Success Standard: can tell us the purpose of the site in the shortest amount of time; it’s easy for the user to understand
Failure Standard: the user takes a while to determine the purpose; it’s difficult for the user to understand

Recruiting Users:
  * People who aren't super familiar with the scope of the site to see if the graphics help them understand
  * People who are somewhat familiar with the site to see if the graphics better their understanding of the site than before
