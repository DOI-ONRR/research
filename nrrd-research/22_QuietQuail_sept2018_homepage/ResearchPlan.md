# Background
We have revised the home page and Explore Data prototypes from the last round of user research.  We want to evaluate these designs with users.  A secondary goal is to flesh out our defined user types more by asking users about how they use the site.
# Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting how it works content on the home page.
* Determine whether the map should come before or after key stats.
* Determine whether the design for interactivity in key stats works.
* Determine whether we need the intro paragraphs on Explore Data.
* Determine whether the reorganization of the Production page works.
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we’d like to speak with 5-9 individuals from several of the following user groups for 1 hour remote 1:1 interviews.  We'll focus more on new users because of the goals of the study.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
# Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who have not used the site before.  We will be developing a strategy for recruiting participants via social media as part of the recruiting effort for this study.

Because we had a really difficult time finding new participants in our defined user groups, we reached out to UX people who work in government to participate in this study.  We figured they'd be suitable to evaluate the ability of the homepage to explain the purpose of the site, since they're coming to the site with fresh eyes and know less about the domain than anyone internal to ONRR.
# Test assets
We will be testing these 3 versions of the home page with users to understand which best helps new users understand the purpose of the site.
* [Home A](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home_a)
* [Home B](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home_b)
* [Home C](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home_c)

Interactive Key Facts (this will be incorporated into the Home page prototypes when finalized)
* [Interactive Key Facts](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=interactive_facts)

Explore Data
* [No paragraphs](https://ug2su1.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_b__shorten_page_)
