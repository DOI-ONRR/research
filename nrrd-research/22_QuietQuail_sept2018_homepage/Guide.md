# Interview Guide

## Intro (5 min)
### Introductions
Welcome, thank you for taking the time to meet with us.  I’m here today along with a few people from my team who are taking notes.  
What we do on this team is talk with people about their tasks and observe them completing tasks, to learn about improvements we can make to the site.  Have you ever participated in research like this before?

## About Testing Prototypes
* We’re going to be looking at some prototypes of designs we’re thinking about.
* Not everything will be clickable.  
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* I’d like you to think out loud
* I want to know what you really think and how you would actually use it.  You can’t hurt my feelings. We want honest feedback so we can make the designs better.
