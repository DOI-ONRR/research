# Sprint-RandyRoo research results

## Hypotheses tested

This was our first major round of research that focused on the new state profile pages. We developed the state profiles to target this hypothesis:

> We believe that: Connecting data within the site better, especially production and revenue...
> Will result in enriched conversations about policy and clearing up misconceptions.

We also hoped to address feedback from prior usability tests, including confusion about revenues and interest in local/state stories.

## Participants

* 4 people who live in (or are from) states with significant extractive activity. We talked people from 4 MSG priority states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Alaska.
* Each person we talked to had relatively high digital literacy and/or moderate subject-matter knowledge: one works on another open data project at 18F, one is a journalist, one is an active concerned citizen, and one works for a nonprofit that partners with federal land management agencies.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the state profile page for their state, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

With this round of usability testing, we saw a major sea change in how users reacted to the site. Here's what we noticed:

* Testers understood the scope and context much more quickly, and clearly enough that they could begin critiquing both the higher-level context of EITI and the details of UI elements.
* Testers engaged with the data itself, and asked real questions about states, industries, and context.
* Testers did not get lost in filters or go down dead-ends, because that's not possible anymore.
* Testers did not get as confused (i.e. about revenue), and when they did, they were often able to correct themselves in the course of browsing the page (without prompting or intervention).

### Specific feedback

#### Maps (general):

- Bothered by the tilt of West Virginia (very used to seeing their state a certain way)

#### Federal land ownership:

- One user wondered how state land ownership stats compare nationally.
- One user commented that the phrase "much like they would to any land owner" was very clear.
- Possibly because the federal land percentage was the first thing visible, one user expressed confusion about whether the entire scope of the page would be limited to federal land.

Quotes:

> What might be helpful is a little intro, like, on this site we’ll talk about the extractive industries on federal land, state land, private land, because otherwise people will see this federal land thing and think this isn’t relevant to me. People in PA...if they just see these specs of federal land at the top they’re gonna go, eeeeh this isn’t that interesting."

#### Revenue introduction:

- Two people wondered what year the revenue chart data is from. [Note: We've already changed the title of this chart to make it clearer.]
- At least two people expressed confusion about what the bars represented in the revenue process chart. One person expected them to add up horizontally to the commodity totals.
- One user toggled repeatedly between the numbers and the explanations; might have been easier to see them side-by-side.
- Still some confusion about what the process phases mean and how to understand these numbers:
    - "What! That’s bullshit" (looking at rent amounts)..."okay, I guess if we’re getting royalties that’s less bad...is that the tax rate, though?"
    - "It's not exactly breaking it down, but maybe I’m not familiar with it."
- Likely don't need to repeat federal land percentage ("Okay, you said that before").

Quotes:

> I like that you define revenue here — this is so well written!

> "This is an interesting and good way to show the phases of owning land and getting money — but I’m confused as to what the whole represents."

#### Revenue by commodity:

- One user equated revenue with taxes (the definition of revenue had scrolled off-screen), and reacted that it was a small amount of taxes.
- One user was confused by the dot denoting the highlighted year.
- Several users quickly understood the scope of what they saw, and expressed interest in state tax revenue as well as federal revenue. This means that the scope of the data is much clearer, though we may need to clarify _why_ the data is scoped that way and provide better links to broader EITI context when appropriate.
- One user opened quite a few details charts and got disoriented by the layout: "I think once I had all these [details] open I think I got lost. But now that I closed them it makes sense."
- One user was confused about the oil, gas, and non-royalty oil/gas charts here: "I see gas and oil, but I guess I’m not clear why there is oil and gas (non-royalty), but what about royalty oil and gas? Is that somewhere else on that page that I missed. Was I not reading carefully, or was that not here?"

#### Production:

- One user was initially confused by the visual similarity to the previous section, and took some time to  notice that the units had changed from money to production units.
- One person mentioned liking the breakdown by industry, but wanted more context for renewables data.

Quotes:

> How is this different from the above? Oh, is this ALL of Texas not just federal land? But I thought you just said we don’t have data because…

#### Federal production:

- Several testers tried to click on county maps. [Which is great because we're planning to make them interactive eventually.]
- Again, at least one user expressed desire for more data about production on state land, which indicates that the scope of the federal production dataset is much clearer.

#### Jobs:

- People really gravitated to this section, and seemed to understand why this was an important measure.
- One tester wanted to be able to sort this table by number or percentage.
- Several testers had existing perceptions about extractives employment, and were looking at this section to validate those perceptions.

Quotes:

> I wanted to get to the employment section. I was thinking that it would tell me how many jobs there are in alaska. What percentage of alaskans are emplyed by the extractive industries and that’s there. That’s great!

> I would expect it [jobs in oil] to be more...I wonder what percent of the economy, or what percent of income comes from oil.

> Is this just jobs that are in the production itself, or does this include related jobs, like hotel and restaurant jobs. It would be useful to clarify whether this is just oil and gas themselves, or all the other industries.

> I’d be curious about parts of the state that I’m familiar with, and where those parts are people who are physically drilling for employment vs. execs in Dallas...and if we stopped drilling more, would those people have options.

### GDP:

- This section seemed to provide the best overall context and validate testers' perceptions of extractive industries' role in their states' economies.
- One user expressed interest in further granularity, and hoped to compare the roles of different industries (for instance, oil/gas vs. renewables).
- One user expressed curiosity about when newer datasets would be available.

Quotes:

> Oh! Okay! That’s the economy — so it **is** higher!

> Wow, 28.7% of the GDP!

> I would want to know how soon the 2014 and 2015 numbers can be available and an explanation of when they could be available. Most people understand why you don’t get them right away. Point out that it isn’t outdated, but why?

#### Exports:

One user expressed confusion about how the terms match up between sections:

> But you were talking about Natural Gas up here...are gas and natural gas the same thing?

#### Disbursements [very minimal content]:

Disbursements is an unfamiliar word, and people weren't sure what it meant:

> What’s a disbursement? Why are they getting money? Aren’t they making money?

> I’m assuming this is like grants to oil companies or something.

#### Overall UI notes:

- Sparkline labels were unclear:
    + "Are these months of the year? I don’t know why it’s 6 through 15"
    + "It isn’t clear [what the year markers in the line chart in employment] are. 7, 8, 9?"
- Dramatic lines/trends could be misleading:
    + "The ups and downs seem really dramatic in the graph. In 2013 it was so hight, but in 2014 it plummeted. But then I go to the chart, and realize you are just taking a snippet, so it didn't plummet."
    + Noted that natural gas and oil production is "skyrocketing"

#### Unclear terms

- Some terms were unclear: "Biomass — what’s biomass?" "What’s Other Biomass?"
- Units need definitions:
    + "I wanna know what mcf is"
    + "I need a key"
    + "What’s BBL?"
    + "I wonder if there could be an explanation for these words (mcf, bbl)"
- "What does _Bonus_ mean?" (Definition doesn’t seem to make sense related to word)

### Overall positive feedback

- "I could definitely see a use for this"
- "I think you guys are really right on the right track."
- "If I was trying to get a sense — like for a school report (there’s a whole lot of Texas history taught in Texas, so I could definitely imagine needing to find info about this) — I would have a pretty easy job; I could sort my way through."
- "The graphics are so clear, it is hard to focus on the design because I want to just look at all the numbers."
- "I’m really excited that this info is available in this way."

## Conclusions

In addition to refining the information heirarchy and UI elements, as well as defining more terms, we should make sure it's easy for users to understand the scope and purpose of EITI from this page (probably through links).
