# Sprint 17b usability test results
	

## Hypotheses tested

- Do people understand what the site is about? YES!
- Can they figure out how to find and navigate stories? YES!
- Do people understand the term 'extractive resources'? KINDA!
- Do people understand the term 'civil society'? NO!
- What problems are most severe? 


## General feedback


### Overall, the response was extremely positive and there was much more clarity in peoples’ responses than there was with the previous iteration. They understand that the site’s purpose is to promote transparency in extractives.

- _This provides information in a very manageable way, unlike many government websites._

We did not get questions like the previous iteration on 'Why am I even here? What is USEITI?'.


#### What is this site for?

- _This is for member of the public who might be interested because there are things like fracking going on in their home or community that they want more about. Public-facing and user-friendly; less technical._
- _To inform the public about extractives, where they come from, where they are, and what companies are getting them, and what the companies are doing to give back to the community_
- _The extractive industry being more transparent with their operations and their revenue_

Note that the way these responses are phrased seem to show that people still think the site is more about the industry and companies than about any other aspect of this space. This may need to be addressed in the future.

Also, there was some feedback that the acronym EITI should be spelled out in the first sentence instead of relying on people to read the logo (the only other place it’s spelled out). This has been addressed in the next iteration.

#### What did you learn?

- _That, according to the site, extractive revenues build libraries.  Interesting link between the inflow of revenues and what’s actually funding._
- _It’s all new! I knew communities had resources, but I didn’t know that this was being tracked and that there’s an economic benefit beyond companies making money._

#### What are you confused about?

- _I'm worried that this highlights the positive and leaves out the negative. I’d also want to know the negative impacts and this website seems very positive._
- _What are the property rights surrounding extractives?  Is it federal or privately owned land?_
- _I want to know the details behind each of these links.  Want to know more about it being an international standard—why are we listening to these standards now instead of before?_


### Navigation

People did not display huge issues with site navigation, now that the initial messaging problems revealed in the previous tests have been addressed. People tried to click in to topics and areas that interested them, and did not mention concerns over what to do next. Once further inner pages have been developed, we will continue to test this.

There were some comments on consistency ('Why is this link a button, but this one is a text link? Do they do the same thing?') that we are addressing in the next iteration as well.


### Terms

#### 'Extractive resources'

This term tests OK. It sounds complex, but when asked, people knew exactly what it meant. The problem here is that then people question why renewables are on the site at all since they aren't 'extracted'. We may return to using 'natural resources' and see how that tests.

#### 'Civil society'

Nobody understood this term. This is the accepted term in the international EITI standard, but does not mean anything to the people we tested, unless they had a specific background in international relations or similar.


### What problems were most severe?

This round of testing did not reveal any severe problems. We will continue to build out the site, in particular some of the more complex interactive modules, and test again as more content and depth is added.
