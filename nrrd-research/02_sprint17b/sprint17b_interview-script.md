# Front page user interview questions, sprint 17b


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 5 minutes of your time."


## Main questions

"I’ve got a prototype version of our new site here. It is not really 'real' yet -- it is more like a Powerpoint than a full website, and some parts aren't clickable yet."

"Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. I'd like to ask you some general questions about what you see here. If you could, please talk out loud as you explore and walk me through what you're thinking. This will help us understand how to improve things later."

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?" 

2. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"

3. "What does this website tell you about extractive resources?" _Note: notice whether or not participants understand this term. If they are confused, explain that extractive resources are things like oil, gas, coal and gold._

3. "What did you learn from this website?"

4. "What questions does this leave you with? Can you walk me through things you think are confusing?"


## Wrap up

"Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future usability tests of our work, please feel free to email me [provide contact info]. Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!"
