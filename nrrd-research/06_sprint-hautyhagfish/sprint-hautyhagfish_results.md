# Sprint-HautyHagfish research results

It turned out that recruiting the right people to talk to (ie, those that matched our persona types) took longer than we expected, and so this analysis work was pushed to another sprint. See results in our [Sarcastic Seacow sprint](https://github.com/ONRR/research/blob/master/nrrd-research/08_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md).
