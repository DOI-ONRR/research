# Sprint-HautyHagfish interview script


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get a general understanding of you and how you might (or might not!) be interested in natural resource extraction in the U.S. This isn't a test to see how much you know, and there are no right or wrong answers. We're designing a website that hopes to help people understand how mineral mining and oil and gas production works in the U.S. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take about 15 to 30 minutes of your time."


## Question outline

*Core*

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me about your job?"

1. "Walk me trough a typical week in your life."

1. "How often are you online?"

1. "What computers or devices do you use?"

1. "Tell me about _mining/oil/gas [choose appropriate resource based on participant location]_ in your state or county."

1. "What other locations are important to you with regard to _mining/oil/gas_ ?"

1. "Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?"

1. "Do you have any questions for me?"

*Potential follow-up, depending on what people say*

1. "Where do you think money from _mining/oil production_ goes?"

1. "Imagine you read a news article on a proposed change to a mine/oil field in a place you care about. Maybe this is a new mine, or maybe this is a mine that's closing. Where would you go to find more information?"

1. _Show the site_ Who do you think this site is for?


## Wrap up

"Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future usability tests of our work, please feel free to email me [provide contact info]. **Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!**"
