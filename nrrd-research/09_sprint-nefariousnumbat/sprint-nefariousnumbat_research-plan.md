# Sprint-NefariousNumbat research plan

## Goals

This is a brief research sprint, focused on following up with people who gave feedback at the USEITI outreach webinar on May 3rd to get more detail or ask further questions. These will be relatively unstructured conversations that help us inform our broader questions about framing and narrative. Questions may include:
    * How did you use the paper Executive Summary, and what did you find useful about it?
    * How have you navigated working with the data as an academic? What would make the data easier to use?
    * How do you see community groups or civil society groups using the site, and what would make it easier for them to use?

## Background

ONRR held an outreach webinar in early May, and several attendees asked questions or offered feedback. Most of them work in or with civil society, which offers a chance to learn more about our "concerned citizen" persona. We'll be following up with them to gather more feedback and ask about how they've used the existing report/data.

## Methods

* 30 min interviews with 3-4 contacts from the webinar
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote


## Script

No script: these will be relatively unstructured conversations based on prior feedback.


## Test asset(s)

None.
