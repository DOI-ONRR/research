# Findings and Recommendations
## Query Tool 
* 6 participants thought the query tool was useful. (+)
* Download data: All 10 participants expected to be able to download what they filtered the tool to and said that is a key function of the tool. (H)
	Recommendation: Add the download function. 
* Grouping: 6 participants were still confused by the grouping function, but thought it was useful once they understood. (M)
  Recommendation: Revisit what we've already tried and come up with other options to test.
* State Breakdowns/counties: 4 participants wanted to interact differently with counties. (M)
  Recommendation: Consider alternate ways to select counties.
* Truncating: One participant noticed the truncation and said getting the full label was necessary to understanding the data. (M)
  Recommendation: Remove truncating.
* Filtering: 3 participants were confused by options hiding in the drop-downs when there's no data associated with them. (L)
  Recommendation: Consider whether we need to explain that we're being smart and	note that if a year or category isn’t listed it’s because there is no data. 
* Table Header: 2 participants wanted more clarity about what they'd selected closer to the table. (L)
  Recommendation: Consider listing out selected filters right above the table.
* Land Category: 2 participants didn't understand the options in the land category drop-down. (L)
  Recommendation: Consider whether we need wording changes and watch in future testing.
* Bugs: Goes to data query tool, selects revenue and nothing happens > instructed to reset 
         It’s not breaking out the counties when county is picked as a column on disbursements. 
         The data query tool wouldn’t work on his computer.  The drop-downs didn’t display after picking from the first one. (Using Chrome) 
  Recommendation: Fix bugs (L)
* All Option: 1 participant chose all and individual states and was confused that it still allowed her to check all boxes (L)
  Recommendation: Make the "All" checkbox select/unselect all other checkboxes.
* Load Time: 2 participants thought query tool was slow or didn’t work. (L)
  Recommendation: Get a database.
* Units: 1 participant expected units for gas to display in the table. (L)
  Recommendation: Consider putting units in the table.
* Sparklines: 1 participant wants to see a trend line for the range of years he picks on the query tool. (Feature)
  Recommendation: Consider adding sparklines to the table. 

## Explore Data Prototype
* General: Participants generally liked the cards. (+)

  Recommendation: Consider this for summaries below the map.
* Map: 2 DORC participants mentioned not liking the offshore areas on the map. (L)
  Recommendation: Watch in future testing.
* Slider: One participant didn’t notice the slider right away. Thinks it should be a drop-down. (L)
  Recommendation: Watch in future testing.
* URL: One participant was worried about how to cite our urls in a story – he wants to be able to link to his filtered view to drop into a story to get readers to the exact      data.(L)
  Recommendation: Make the page such that you can get a url with any selections you make.
* Drill down: 3 participants wanted to be able to click on things to drill down to details. (Feature)
  Recommendation: Consider making charts and maps click into details.
* Summary: One participant would like to see ranking of the states on explore data. (Feature)
  Recommendation: Consider this for summaries below the map.
* Usage: Certain types of users just want the data.  (Behavior)
  Recommendation: Keep this in mind when prioritizing features.
* Comparisons: Participants wanted to be able to compare national to state and county, and across states and counties, for all data types. (Feature)
  Recommendation: Consider this for summaries below the map
 
## Download Data
* State: When he selects a state, he wants to be able to see just that state's data when he clicks download & documentation. (L)
  Recommendation: Add ability to download what the query tool filtered selection.
* Desire to download: Many participants want to download the whole file regardless of other features on the site. (Behavior)
  Recommendation: Keep this in mind when prioritizing features.
  
## Homepage
* Query Tool Links: Six participants had trouble finding the query tool. (H)
  Recommendation: Add Query Data to the header nav.

  Recommendation: Watch in future testing. 
* Disbursements: 1 participant wanted LWCF to be better called out on the disbursements tab. Didn’t think you should have to go to the ‘how disbursement works’ link and have it   be a sub menu or dropdown in the disbursement tab or in a whole other tab “data by distribution type”. (L)
  Recommendation: Consider splitting out LWCF on disbursements trends.

## Other

  Recommendation: Consider whether we should have oil & gas products grouped or a better definition of the grouped "oil & gas" category.

  Recommendation: Consider this when prioritizing adding data to the site. 
* Nav Prototype: Participants generally liked the organization of the new nav. (L)
  Recommendation: Launch with what we have and watch the use of the word "query" in future testing with non-expert users.​​
* Production - Units: 2 participants expressed confusion over production units. (L)
  Recommendation: Clarify units.
