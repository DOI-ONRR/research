# Home page 
* Charts and Trends: Participants understood the charts but hover function was unclear. Confusion on lack of y-axis on trendlines, hard to learn anything from trend lines. Some expected the how it works link to explain charts
* Tabs: Expected site to be organized by the tab categorization.
# Finding Data
* Explore data page: Overwhelming, could not figure out how to get county data from explore data page, want the ability to compare revenue and disbursement
* Revenue by company: No one found it, hard time understanding terminology, assume data to be in the query tool, want the ability to copy or download the data for company once it's found, expect text on left to be tied to filters.​.
* Downloads: Download links should directly download a file
* Query Tool: Slow, no issues navigating, helpful for collecting data. 
# State pages 
* Expect the download link from state pages to download data just for that state selected.
* Expect monthly data for states to be in state pages
* No issues finding the state pages
# General Website
* Like the ability to use map to find information
* Slow content load speed
* Hard to find revenuedata.doi.gov from onrr.gov
