# What we tested
## Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
  * Can they find the data they want using the prototypes?
  * Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  * Which approach works best?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  * Where does the site fit into the user’s flow of work?
## Test Method
* 1 hour remote interviews
* Discussion of where the portal fits into their process
* Task-based testing of live site and prototypes 
  * Prototypes: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_1.html
  * We alternated the order the designs were presented to avoid bias due to the order in which the prototypes are presented. After participants went through all designs, we had them select their preferred option and probed into the functionality that they liked or didn't like across options.
# Who we interviewed
We interviewed 4 storytellers, 2 question answerers, 1 agenda supporter, and 1 domain learner.

# Findings summary
Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
* Users liked the added ability to **slice and dice** the data to get to the information they want.  They also liked the added detail of commodity and monthly data because it allows more slicing and dicing.
* Horizontal bar charts won for the **summary display**, by a long shot.
* The single **table** allows users to compare in ways that they can’t with the split tables and that seems to be important to users.
* Users want an easy way to get **explanations** about where the data came from and what it means.
* Participants said they liked **charts**, in theory, but then said it would depend on whether they actually match their question, so they should be secondary. 
* Participants had issues **navigating** the current site, particularly using search and the offshore region page.
Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
* We know a lot about Question Answerers and Storytellers, but need to learn more about Domain Learners and Agenda Supporters.
# Slicing and dicing
User impact: High
* All of the participants mentioned that they liked how the new designs allow them to filter and drill down into the data to get to the data they want and they were able to get to the information much more quickly than they were using the live site.
* Several mentioned having detailed data would allow them to do more slicing and dicing.  In particular, they were interested in
  * Year over year trends (6)
  * Commodity (4)
  * Calendar/fiscal/sales year (4)
  * Onshore/offshore (3)
  * Monthly (2)
  * Flaring & venting (1)
  * Royalty relief (1)
  * Sales value (1)
  * More totals (1) 
  
Recommendation: Determine what we can reasonably add to the site.
# Summary display
User impact: High
We showed 5 options for summary displays for federal and 3 for state.

[Fed A](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1a.html)
[Fed B](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1b.html)
[Fed C](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1c.html)
[Fed D](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1d.html)
[Fed E](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1e.html)

[State A](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/state_a.html)
[State B](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/state_b.html)
[State C](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/state_c.html)
## Summary display ratings
I took all of the reactions from participants and created a score for each design.
Favorite: +2, Positive: +1, Neutral: 0, Negative: -1

| Design | Fed | State | Notes |
| ------ | --- | ----- | ----- |
Vertical Bar Graphs (Fed A, State A) | 0 | -1 | People who liked this, liked the trend over time, but some found it lacking in explanations or didn’t like that you couldn’t compare the graphs with each other.  On the state side, people were confused that not all the graphs added up to a total. |
Horizontal Bar Graphs (Fed B, State B) | 11 | 7 | People thought this best explained what was going on. |
Cards with Words (Fed C) | 0 | N/A | Many thought this was too text heavy. |
Cards with Charts (Fed D) | 0 | N/A | Some people liked this, but many thought it was confusing to mix chart types. |
Table (Fed E, State C) | 4 | 0 | Many thought the table was straightforward, but lacked visual appeal.  Some were confused when the table format changed after clicking down a level. |

Recommendation: Use the horizontal bar graphs.
# Table view
User impact: High

We showed 2 options for the table view for federal and 1 for state.

[Fed 1](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/states.html)
[Fed 2](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_2.html)
[State](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/texas_totals.html)

I’m not convinced that everyone got that the first option was displaying different tables for each recipient.  When I explained and asked participants to compare the two, I got these responses.
* 4 participants liked Fed 2 better
  * Ability to compare and customize the view
  * Business-like, clean and direct
  * Rolled up
  * Easy to navigate
  * Like using Excel without having to download
* 3 participants liked Fed 1 better
  * Wanted the financial flows first before digging into commodity types
  * Thought it was easier

Recommendation: Use the Fed 2 rolled up table because it allows comparisons that the split up tables don’t allow.
# Explanations
| Finding | Participants | Recommendation | User Impact |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| Participants wanted more easily |  accessible explanations about where the numbers came from and what they mean in the context of looking for a number. | 4 | Create a standard interaction for learning more about a number. | High |
| Participants were confused about the difference between source and commodity, but none had a suggestion for a better label. | 4 | Consider other labels for this or make sure there are explanations to go with the label. | High |
| The two participants who started on onrr.gov said they didn’t know what the “NRRD Portal” was and said that label needs to be clearer. | 2  | Better spell out the name of the site in the primary link from onrr.gov. | High |
| Participants noted that we need to be clearer about what we’re keeping from EITI and what our mission is now. | 2 | Consider better calling out what our mission is now that we’re not EITI. | Med |
| The one participant familiar with tribal recipients said that the label should include tribal landowners and not just tribes. | 1 | Change the label to American Indian Tribes & Landowners. | Low |
| One participant had issues with the glossary links because they looked like regular links to her. | 1 | Consider this when we decide what interaction we want to use for explanations. | Low (related to first item above) |

# Charts

User impact: Medium

Participants had mixed thoughts about charts.

* Three participants said they liked charts, but wanted them to go along with the data and to be able to toggle between the two.
* Three participants didn’t think charts would be useful because it’s not likely that they’d match up to their specific question.
* Three participants said they’d use charts if they could be customized to meet their specific need (matched their query, had source attribution, could facilitate comparison).
* Mixed charts on State A page and Fed 1D were problematic for many participants.  Some also had issues with the vertical bar charts having different scales for each chart, which made it hard to compare across charts.

Recommendation: Keep charts for high level facts and as a secondary way to view detailed data.  Ensure any charts we’re showing on the same page can easily be compared.

# Navigation
| Finding | Participants | Recommendation | User Impact |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| Participants who used site search had issues.  They thought that the clickable tags would take them to a page and didn’t understand which results would take them to external pages. | 4 | Redesign site search to return more internal pages, clarify when a page is external, and clarify what the tags are for. | Med |
| Participants who clicked on the Gulf of Mexico offshore region page expected it to function like a state page with disbursements related to GOMESA on the page. | 3 (2 internal, 1 external) | Explore whether it makes sense for offshore region pages to parallel state pages. | Med|

### Scenarios
* Bob from **Intergovernmental Affairs** in the Office of the Secretary routinely pulls data to inform his interactions with Interior Stakeholders. He only has one week to generate a GoMESA disbursements data trend analysis to present to Gulf state elected officials. He’s able to find detailed, up-to-date GoMESA raw data to use as the basis of his analysis.
* Laura works for an **NGO**. She’s concerned about increasing volumes of oil being transported by train through her state following a recent derailment. She wants to determine if oil production on federal lands has recently increased to help her interpret transportation-related risks to her state. She can easily find data that she trusts for oil production on federal lands. She can use that along with state production and export volumes, from other sources, to complete her analysis.

## User Type 3: Storyteller
We've interviewed 5 storytellers. And one user who was a question answerer for how he finds data, but a storyteller for how he uses it.

* Sidney is a **professor** of public policy at a major university, and is writing an academic article focusing on how public land management balances recreation, energy production, and conservation priorities. Sidney is able to locate federal production volumes and locations on the NRRD site, and is able to use that data to inform their points in the article about federal government land-use policy.
* A **journalist** at a major regional news outlet is writing a story about policy claims about energy production on public land. They’re able to find data about production trends both at the national and regional/state level, which helps them back up their story with accurate numbers that haven’t been influenced by personal or political objectives.

## User Type 4: Domain Learner
We've interviewed 2 domain learners.
![Domain learner users on a matrix](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/19_gratefulgopher/DomainLearner.PNG)

Martha ran for county commission largely on a platform of government transparency and accountability, and she wants to know how extractive revenues from federal land are disbursed at the state and county level. Using the site, she’s able to find out how much was disbursed to her county and state each month, which allows her to hold the state accountable, advocate for her constituents, and inform public debate about extractive industry in her county.
* Henry is among the leadership of a **tribal nation**. He is concerned about the layers of bureaucracy involved in tribal land governance and is working with the federal government to simplify the process for land-use authorization. Henry is able to find information on the tribal leasing process to inform his efforts.
