# Background
We have updated a data query tool to be able to query data by production, revenue, and disbursements and then by landowner, location, revenue type, commodity, source, disbursement source and fiscal year. 
## Goals
* Determine whether the new explore data page is usable 
* Identify areas that need fixing 
* Prioritize charts that haven't been built yet  

## Method and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview at least 9 participants from the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on users that have oil and gas experience and understand natural resources data.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.

## Recruitment Strategy
* In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who are familiar with the site or oil and gas revenue data. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.
* We are hoping to speak with users who are familiar with our data and can help evaluate if the data organization makes sense.

# Interview guide
## Intro (5 min)
* Introductions 
* Welcome, thank you for taking the time to meet with us.  I’m here today along with a few people from my team who are taking notes.   
* What we do on this team is talk with people about their tasks and observe them completing tasks, to learn about improvements we can make to the site.  Have you ever participated in research like this before? 
* External users: Did {Maroya or Lindsay} send you the consent form to sign? It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information 
* What the consent for is about (if the participant has any questions): It outlines your rights as a participant and says we won’t misuse your personal information. 

## User Task Background (15 min)
* What is your role and how do you use natural resources data in that role?
* Have you used the Natural Resources Revenue portal before?
  * Tell me a little bit about what you use the Portal for.
* What is your overall process when you are using natural resource data?
  * What are your goals?
  * What do you want people to know?
  * How do you know what data or numbers you need for your work?
  * How do you know where to look?
  * How do you verify the data you are going to use?
  * What does your output look like?
* What are the most important pieces of information to you?

## About Testing Prototypes
* We’re going to be looking at some prototypes of designs we’re thinking about. 
* Not everything will be clickable.   
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* I’d like you to think out loud  
* I want to know what you really think and how you would actually use it.  You can’t hurt my feelings. We want honest feedback so we can make the designs better.  


## Tasks & Questions:
### Start at the [Home Page] (https://dev-nrrd.app.cloud.gov/)
* Take a look at this page and tell me your general thoughts? 
* What do you think of the information that’s presented?

  * Do you expect the total revenue for each year to be displayed on the table? 
  * What does “Not tied to a lease” mean to you? 
  * Are the trends helpful? 
* Task: Can you tell me how much royalties were generated from oil production in Colorado in 2016? ( The purpose of this task is to see how the user will find the query tool since this task can’t be performed on the homepage)

  * Do you expect the total disbursement for each year to be displayed in the table? 
  * Are the trends helpful?
