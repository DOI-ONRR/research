# Findings Summary
* Homepage
  * Adding the revenue trends to the Overview tab:
   * Hindered users' understanding of how the process works.
   * Changed how users perceive the tabs on the homepage. They thought they updated the whole page.
   * Created new questions about the process, requiring additional context up front.
  * People still want to use the map and had a hard time finding it at the bottom of the homepage.
* Navigation
  * Participants had a difficult time understanding the hierarchy of the site and, as a result, didn't find the links to the filterable table.
  * The revenue mega graph caused confusion.
  * Two participants didn't notice the right nav.
* Filterable Tables
 * Participants generally understood how the filterable tables worked, were able to use them to complete their tasks, and had a positive reaction to them.
 * There were some minor issues:
   * Having a mix of filters/grouping/things that don and don’t need apply at the top of the filterable table caused a bit of confusion.
   * Participants needed definitions of terms they didn’t understand.
   * Participants wanted to be able to download the filtered view.
   * Adding calendar year will add value as will defining what the fiscal year is.
   * Adding monthly data will add less value than calendar year.
   * The table took a really long time to load for a couple participants.
   * A couple of participants wanted to be able to filter by other locations, such as multiple states or basins.
   * A few participants had difficulty with the "not tied to..." items.
* Charts
  * Visuals and charts are useful for people to get an overview of the scope of the data.
  * Two participants had issues with the y axis on bar charts.
  * A couple of participants didn't understand the interactivity on the homepage charts.
* Other findings
  * Participants generally thought the font was easy to read, but a couple noted it was lighter and harder to read in the filterable table.
  * Nobody we talked with would use voice.
  * CSVs are useful for anyone who analyzes data in anything other than Excel.
  * People who work within ONRR want sales data.
  * A few participants had a difficult time understanding withheld data.
  * The two participants who saw the county choropleth map liked it, but they got that there was more value in being able to click on the states.
  * Participants encountered a few bugs.
   * Glossary and header links are broken on the offshore region pages.
   * There’s extra space below the charts on the offshore region pages.
   * State drop-down isn’t in alphabetical order.

# Summary of Recommendations
* Implement a revised version of the tabbed homepage.
* Prioritize the Explore Data page changes.
* Consider that users want to use charts to get an overview of the data when developing a chart strategy.
* Revisit the y-axis issue, since we’ve seen this in a number of studies.
* Watch the interactive charts on the homepage in future studies.
* Filterable table:
  * Revise the filter functionality for more consistency with what needs to use Apply and label what is and isn’t filters better.
  * Add glossaries or put definitions of terms in the narrative at the top of the page.
  * Add download function.
  * Add calendar year data.
  * Define the fiscal year.
  * Possibly add monthly data.
  * Consider allowing picking multiple states.
  * Consider whether to darken the font in the filterable tables.
* Don’t implement voice.
* Add CSVs to the site.
* Consider adding sales data.
* Clarify withheld data explanations.
* Use a state-level choropleth.
* Fix bugs.
