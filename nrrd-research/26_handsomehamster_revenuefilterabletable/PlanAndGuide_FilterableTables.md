# Plan
We have created a revenue  filterable table to be able to sort  through federal revenue by fiscal years, calendar years and months  using various relevant filters. The table allows the users to customize the columns and organize by; revenue type,  commodity, location, source, and land owner.  We want to observe how users navigate the table and document any usability issues.

## Goals
Determine whether the revenue filterable table meets user needs.
Determine if the revenue trends on the homepage are useful.
Understand what specific questions users want to answer using the site.
Determine if the new font causes any issues.
Determine whether users want charts in addition to the filterable tables.

## Test method
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like  to interview at least 9 participants from the following user groups for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on users that have oil and gas experience and understand revenue data.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.

## Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who are familiar with the site or oil and gas revenue data. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.

We are hoping to speak with users who are familiar with our data and can help evaluate if the data organization makes sense.

## Test assets
We will test the live site with particular attention to the [homepage](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/) and [revenue filterable table](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/explore/revenue/).
