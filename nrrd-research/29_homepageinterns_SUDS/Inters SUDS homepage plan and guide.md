# Plan
We want to test our new home page with our interns who are new to the site and also introduce them to the way we conduct a user study. 

## Goals
* Get feedback on  new homepage design.  
* Determine if tabs styling are intuitive and used as expected. 
* Determine if links are easy to find. 
* Observe how users navigate around the new homepage given a task. 
* The study will serve as an introduction to how we conduct user studies.  

## Method and desired participants
Over the course of a few days, we would like  to interview our interns for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on the new homepage design.  actually use the site because they will have real questions that they look for the site to answer.

## Recruitment
We will recruit our interns. 

# Interview guide
## Intro
Thank you for taking the time to participate in our research study. I will be conducting the interview, and my teammates will be listening in to take notes and observe.
Our team’s goal is  to understand how people use our site and the questions they expect our site to be able to answer.  If we have time, we’ll also look at some design ideas at the end of the session.

## Interview questions
Take some time to look around and tell us what you think this website is about? 

I will give your some scenarios of different user types needing to find specific information on our website and I would like for you to show me how you would navigate on the website to find that information. 

* Scenario 1: A congressional staffer needs specific , accurate data on how much oil was produced on federal land in their state (Texas) in 2016.  Where can they find this information on the website? 

* Scenario 2: A public affairs officer from Chevron (an oil company)  needs to get numbers to use in press release about their company’s federal revenue resource extraction and compare it to other companies. Where can they find this information on the website? 

* Scenario 3: A journalist is writing a story about government data being open and transparent, they need to provide an example of how the public needs to be informed on how extractive revenues from federal land are disbursed at the local  level.  Where can they find this information on the website?  

* Scenario 4: An analyst for an NGO is concerned about increasing volumes of oil being transported by train through their state following a recent derailement in March 2019. They want to determine if oil production on federal lands has recently increased that month compared to the previous month to help interpret transportation-related risks to their state. Where can they find this information on the website? 

## General Tasks
