# Background
We have created a data query tool to be able to query data by production, revenue, and disbursements and then by landowner, location, revenue type, commodity, source, We have updated a data query tool to be able to query data by production, revenue, and disbursements and then by landowner, location, revenue type, commodity, source, disbursement source and fiscal year.  We want to observe how users navigate the tool and document any usability issues.

## Goals
* Primary Goal: Determine whether the data query tool meets user needs. 
  * Understand what tasks users would want to complete with the tool 
  * Determine whether the tool helps users accomplish those tasks.
  * Answer outstanding questions about the tool 
    * Determine how the user expects to access the tool from the Explore Data and home pages 
    * Determine if the filter options are self explanatory. 
    * Determine if they want monthly data added to the tool. 
    * Determine whether users understand the nuances of withheld data and when there isn’t a location or commodity tied to revenue. 
    * Determine whether users understand the grouping/break out function. 

* Secondary Goal: Understand what specific questions users want to answer using the site. 

## Method and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we would like to interview at least 9 participants for 30 minute 1:1 interviews. We will focus on question answerer users that have oil and gas experience and understand natural resources data, since the query tool is targeted to question answerers. 

## Recruitment Strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who are familiar with the site or oil and gas revenue data. We will recruit internally from ONRR and externally.

We are hoping to speak with users who are familiar with our data and can help evaluate if the data organization makes sense.

## Test Assets:

We will be testing the following:
* The query tool links on the home page that takes the user to the query tool  to understand if users understand the links’ purpose and if placement is intuitive.  
  * Home page with link to query tool
* Query Tool functionality
* Filter options
  * Grouping/break out 
  * No location or commodity associated

### Query Tool functionality
* Query options
* Monthly, fiscal year or calendar year
* Withheld data or no location associated

# Interview guide
## Intro
Thank you for taking the time to participate in our research study. I will be conducting the interview, and my teammates will be listening in to take notes and observe.
Our team’s goal is to talk to users about our site, test how they would complete a task, and observe how they are using it to learn about possible improvements to the site. If we have time, we’ll also look at some design ideas at the end of the session.
External users: digitally sign giving us permission to conduct the study. It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information

## User Task Background (people don’t fit our user profiles) (5 min)
Tell us a little bit about your background, so we can get a sense for where your perspective is coming from.

## User Task Background (people who fit our user profiles whom we haven’t interviewed before) (20 min)
* What is your role and how do you use natural resources data in that role?
* Have you used the Natural Resources Revenue portal before?
  * Tell me a little bit about what you use the Portal for.
* What is your overall process when you are using natural resource data?
  * What are your goals?
  * What do you want people to know?
  * How do you know what data or numbers you need for your work?
  * How do you know where to look?
  * How do you verify the data you are going to use?
  * What does your output look like?
* What are the most important pieces of information to you?
* Is natural resources revenue data important to you?
  * How do you currently access data you need to do your job?
  * What struggles/problems have you encountered when looking for this data?
* What kind of questions do you need to answer about natural resources revenue data? Can you give a specific example?

## Interview testing Process:
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* There are no right or wrong answers.
* Please think out loud as we are conducting the interview for us to understand your thought process as you are exploring the site. We want to know what you would do if we weren’t watching.
* We appreciate your honest feedback to help us improve our designs

## Query Tool 
https://dev-nrrd.app.cloud.gov/query-data/ 

## Tasks & Questions:
Finding the tool and user directed questions
1. Can you tell me a specific question you have about natural resources revenue? How would you find that information using this website?
* How easy or difficult was it to find the answer?
* What do you think of the information that’s presented?
* Is this information useful?
* Are there pieces of information that you wouldn’t use?
Probes:
* Query options
* Filter options
* Grouping/break outs
2. Are there other tasks you might use this tool to complete? Probe into tasks for revenue and disbursements and use those, if possible. If they can’t come up with their own tasks, use the ones below.
3. Show them the Explore Data page then ask: Did you expect the filters you select in the query tool or explore data to stick when you switch between the two?  

Revenue Tasks
1. If you wanted to know how much revenue Texas generated from Federal onshore in FY 2017, how would you do that?
2. Can you tell us how much federal offshore revenue was collected in Calendar Year 2014?
3. How would you find out how much revenue was generated from bonuses in 2016?

General probes
* Is the answer where you expected it to be?
* Is there anything that doesn’t make sense?
* Does the location of the query tool make sense?
* What do you think of the filter options? Are there any you would add or remove?
* Do they understand the Grouping and Break Out function? 
* What would they do with the data once they’ve found it? 
* Are there other areas of the site you’re interested in looking at? Probe into whether they would use Explore Data. 


## Close
* Are you interested in participating in future studies? Do you have any other specific areas of the site (or data elements) that you’re interested in providing your feedback on?
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with?
* Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve our site. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
