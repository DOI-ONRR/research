# Information architecture usability test results


## Hypotheses tested

- Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation? KINDA!
- What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms? (see below)
- Do people understand what the site is about? CLOSER!
- We've starting moving towards global nav as categories throughout the site. Is this making the information structure clearer? TENTATIVE YES!
- What problems are most severe? (see below)


## Participants

- 3 people unfamiliar with USEITI in the following locations: Dayton, OH and Tucson, AZ


## Let's talk about that global navigation

This was a continuation of the our Sprint-MightyMoose testing cycle. Based on [initial results](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/03_%20sprint-mightymoose/sprint-mightymoose_results.md) from that, we adjusted the global navigation slightly in a way we hoped would reduce confusion and improve clarity. The focus of this test was, as before, still the global navigation, and by proxy, the information architecture of the site. We tested a navigation with five options: home, how it works, explore data, local impact, and downloads.

### How it works

Our previous iteration of this navigation called this 'Natural Resources,' which led to confusion on the difference between this section and 'Explore Data.' This iteration, switching the words to 'How it works' solved the confusion problem, but what might be found here is still ambiguous for people. However, people **are** linking 'How it works' to the carousel below for further clues.

- _This is ambiguous. I get a little clue from this [points to carousel with similar words in it] but I’m just not sure. What is ‘it’?_

- _Um, presumably something like the box below that’s like ‘how do natural resources become natural revenues?” I’m thinking this is something about the extraction about this stuff get extracted and the revenues that the government gets._

Instead of having overlap between this section and 'Explore Data,' we now have a bit of mental map overlap with this section and "about this site"- or "about USEITI"-type of information.

- _I don’t think it means how the site works._

- _Based on what I’ve seen, I would expect this section to describe all the legal background for creating this initiative, how its funded, the organization, presentation of the data is carried out. Maybe a paragraph saying ‘we have offices in Houston, and DC, to find data and make it transparent’ or ‘who we hire’ (like, what contractors). I would not expect it to tell me how to use the site or the data, primarily because I see explore next to it._

**Potential solution:** Add 'About USEITI' to the global navigation.

### Explore Data

The term Explore Data still stayed clear in this iteration, as it was last time. People expected data, and generally expected some sort of ability to interact with data and drill in.

- _For something like this, for accountability and trust, I would expect curated data...so we can make our own conclusions._

- _Here I’d expect visualizations of data, raw data on its own doesn’t mean a whole lot to me._

- _Presumably a data browser or search sort of thing. I don’t know, maybe nifty interactive maps and stuff._

### Local Impact

Trends for this navigation item continued from our first study, with people expecting local engagement in this section, either through the ability to see information (narrative and data) by state or local area, or through ways to contact governments or organizations to get involved.

As with before, the word 'impact' is not clear because people wonder about what *kind* of impact, and in addition the word *impact* is strongly associated with the phrase *environmental impact*.

- _Um, so at first I assumed it was location-specific revenue. Now I think it’s like ‘here’s what the money did after it got to your region’, but this is federal money, so I don’t think so. Back to my first guess._

- _I have no idea. [laughs] Nothing about this seems local to me. It’s all about the federal level, save a penny in taxes this year. Or spend an extra penny? Maybe a link to my congressman or something, I have no idea._

- _I’m really interested in that [local impact]. [However] Are we talking about digging, like environmental impact? Or the money coming back to communities from extraction?_

As we adjust the content on the main page to be less revenues-focused, I hypothesize that the answers to this question will change. We will continue to test.


### Downloads

As with our first tests, people were in general confused about this term. Many people were able to guess what would be here, but it causes a pause.

- _Can I get data and manipulate it myself?_

- _Hmmm. Weird. I would expect downloads to be superseded by explore data. Without explore data, I would expect downloads to have data. Since that exists, I would think download would be stuff like on other big gov or industry website – here’s our official logo you can use, press releases, stuff like that._

- _I don’t understand the difference between this and explore data. Maybe an app or something? After a minute of thought, maybe this is where you get big chunks of data. Bulk data is my guess._


## How about that global nav as categories throughout the site? Is this making the information structure clearer?

This still gets a tentative yes. Some participants picked up on the repetition of themes, in particular now that we've changed 'Natural Resources' to 'How it works' because words like this feature prominently in the intro carousel. However, this can't be confirmed until we get more content into the site and let people explore.


## We snuck a first-version glossary icon into this layout, how did it do?

**Not so hot.** Almost every participant went straight to that icon when asked the final "Is there anything that confuses you about this site" question.

- _[immediately] Waaay upper right, the little book icon. First of all it looked like a shopping bag at first. I don’t know what it is._

- _[Points to book icon in upper right] I don’t know what this is._


## General feedback

Overall, we are ever-closer to a first-glance understanding of what the site is for.

- _Looks like I’m going to be getting data on extractive industries._

- _[This is a site about] how much is in different industries and how it is managed._

We still see skepticism around the initiative.

- _Right off the bat, I can’t tell if this is a government site or a corporate site. I’m very suspicious of corporate sites._

- _My first impression is that this is an industry site....So, now that I’ve looked further down, maybe this [site] is from someone who doesn’t like the oil and gas industry? Maybe its not a government site. Like, The United States Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, ha, is a lot to swallow. But...wait [reads words under it] the words here describe what’s going on pretty well. But the agency name makes no sense to me. Sounds like it’s a bill in Congress._

We will continue to test this as we add more content to the site. Also, we're going to test adding an in-context link in the intro to the 'About USEITI' part of the site, and adding an 'About USEITI' to the global navigation.


### What problems were most severe?

The biggest problem is the confusion over what people will get when they click on 'How it works'. We have solved the mix-up between that content and the content in 'Explore Data' that we had previously, but now there's confusion between 'How it works' and 'About USEITI' information.

Potential solutions are linked to the continued skepticism about the overall site purpose. The most important thing to test next is methods to provide more obvious links to the USEITI process. We are considering an in-text link in the intro block and an additional global navigation item called 'About USEITI' or 'About the initiative'.

As with our previous tests, 'Local Impact' and 'Downloads,' while unclear in certain ways, are less risky to leave as-is for now because their problems so not indicate essential issues for site architecture. As the content of the site fills out, we will revisit those terms and test on a more full-formed site.
