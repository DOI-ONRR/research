# Background
We had a few people signed up for interviews between studies and findings from showing a couple of the lease level interview participants the production filterable tables in December that we never did anything with the findings.
# Goals
* Continue research into lease level use cases
  - What tasks users want to complete with lease and well level data.

  - Whether a geographic component is important.
  - Determine if there is a use case for lease level data for the general public
* Learn from new site users
  - Determine if the live site is easy to navigate for someone who hasn’t seen the site before
  - Determine if the home page’s content is relevant to someone who hasn’t seen the site before
  - Determine if the explore data page is relevant to someone who hasn’t seen the site before
  - Determine if the How it works page is relevant to someone who hasn’t seen the site before

* Learn whether the filterable table designs are usable
  - Determine if the design of the revenue filterable table makes sense and if one of the two options works better
  - Get feedback on initial production filterable table design with lease level data




# Methods and desired participants
30 minute interviews with internal ONRR users and external users.

# Recruitment strategy
We had one carry-over participant from the last round of lease level interviews that was rescheduled because of the shutdown and two internal ONRR people who were visiting the DC office.  We also pulled in data from the lease level interviews from 3 participants who saw the production filterable table designs.
