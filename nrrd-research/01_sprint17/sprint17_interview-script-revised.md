# Front page user interview questions, revised

Note: This work is based on a template available [here](https://myusa.hackpad.com/Template-Onsite-User-Interview-Questions-y08pqBL0EvA) from the MyUSA team. Thank you, MyUSA!


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 5 minutes of your time."


## Main questions

"I’ve got a printed version of the front page here. Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. If you could, please put a question mark next to anything (word, phrase, section, prompt) that you find confusing. Put a plus sign next to anything that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. Finally, draw a minus sign next to anything you're not interested in/want to see less of."

"Awesome – thank you. Now that you've seen the some of our site, I'd like to ask you a few general questions about what you think."

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?" 

2. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"

3. "What does this website tell you about extractive resources?" _Note: notice whether or not participants understand this term. If they are confused, explain that extractive resources are things like oil, gas, coal and gold._

3. "Is there anything on this page that you didn’t know before?"

4. "What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"


## Wrap up

"Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future usability tests of our work, please feel free to email me [provide contact info]. Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!"
