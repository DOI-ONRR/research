## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate reconciliation page | What do people think this page is saying?
Evaluate reconciliation page messaging | Do people see that reconciliation is not a problem in the US?
 | Do people understand that the variances were all explained?
Evaluate general usability of visualization interactions | How do people interact with the maps, filters and options?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

We launched version one of our site last December, but didn't yet have a dataset about one of the core pieces of the international EITI process ('reconciliation') ready for view. It is a complex concept and a complex dataset about a concept that is not familiar to those outside the EITI process. We now have a prototype of a visualization using this data and we need to see if we're hitting the mark.

Also, we want to use this opportunity to test our site's data visualizations in general, since they all use similar layouts and interactions.


## Methods
