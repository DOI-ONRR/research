# Background
We have created some new designs for key facts on the home page and revised the disbursements prototypes from the last round of user research.  We also have some concepts for social media we want to put in front of users.  We want to evaluate these designs with users.  A secondary goal is to flesh out our defined user types (especially domain learners) more by asking users about how they use the site.
# Goals and questions
* Determine the best approach for presenting key facts on the website.
  - Is the data presented useful?
  - Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  - Which approach works best?
* Refine approach for disbursements.
  - Are there any usability issues with the design?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  - Where does the site fit into the user’s flow of work?
* Determine the best approach for social media.
  - Do any of the options for social media work?
# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of this sprint, we’d like to speak with 5-9 individuals from several of the following user groups skewed towards domain learners for 60-minute remote 1:1 interviews.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
# Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who have previously been identified as potential participants.
