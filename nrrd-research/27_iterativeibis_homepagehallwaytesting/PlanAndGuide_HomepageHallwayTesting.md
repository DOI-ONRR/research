# Plan
We wanted to get quick feedback on new designs for the homepage based on the findings from the previous study, so we conducted quick 15 minutes testing with ONRR employees via Google Hangouts.  We reached out to people via Google Chat, similar to how we would have found people in the hallway in a physical office.

We showed 4 design options to 8 ONRR employees, focusing mostly on people who donâ€™t have a good understanding of the inner workings of the production/revenue/disbursement process, such as administrative assistants and people who work on the web team, and with a few who do know the process.

## Goals
* Determine whether Narrower Tabs fixed the problems we saw in previous testing.
* Determine whether Not Tabs or Cleaner Toggles better solved the problem.
* Determine whether Cleaner Toggles make it clear the toggles are clickable.
* Determine whether we should replace the revenue trendlines with a bar chart and whether the trendlines should come before or after the bar chart.

## Designs
[Narrower tabs](https://88sw92.axshare.com/#g=1&p=narrower_tabs): Moves the revenue trends outside of the tab area.
[Cleaner toggles](https://88sw92.axshare.com/#g=1&p=cleaner_toggles): Groups revenue, production, disbursements, and state data into sections.  Moves revenue trends to the right.
[Not tabs](https://88sw92.axshare.com/#g=1&p=not_tabs): Different affordance from Cleaner toggles with revenue trends on the left.
[Two graphs](https://88sw92.axshare.com/#g=1&p=two_graphs): Replaced the revenue trends with a second bar graph.
