# Background
We have revised the home page prototypes from the last round of user research and created new designs for the Explore Data page.  We want to evaluate these designs with users.  A secondary goal is to flesh out our defined user types more by asking users about how they use the site.
# Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting key stats data on the home page.
* Determine whether the home page content helps users understand the purpose of the site.
* Determine whether any of the alternative home page designs work better than the current state.
* Determine the whether the Explore Data page helps users understand the structure of the data that's available.
* Determine whether any of the alternative designs for Explore Data work better than the current state.
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we’d like to speak with 5-9 individuals from several of the following user groups for 1 hour remote 1:1 interviews.  We'll focus more on new users because of the goals of the study.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
# Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who have not used the site before and people who signed up for user research in the new employee orientation.
