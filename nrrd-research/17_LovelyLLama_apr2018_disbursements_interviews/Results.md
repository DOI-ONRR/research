# What we tested
We conducted 7 interviews with users about their usage of disbursements.  
# Who we interviewed
We interviewed 4 question answerers, 1 storyteller, 1 domain learner, and 1 question answerer/storyteller. 5 were internal to ONRR and 2 were external.

# Summary of findings
## Participants wanted more broken out data than we currently provide for disbursements.
* Commodity (2)
* Monthly (2)
* Product (2)
* Company (1)
* Contract (1)
* Breakouts that are in budget documents (1)
* GOMESA (1)
* Estimates (1)
* Sales year (1)
* Yearly trends (1)

## Internal processes make it difficult to get the data users want
* Data coming out of different databases doesn't match
* There isn't a common understanding about which data is okay to show and which has to be withheld
* The more broken out data we provide, the more likely it is to have issues with matching up

## Internal users liked the stats page
4 of the 5 internal users mentioned this.  Neither of the external users did.

## We're just one source of data and people use multiple sources.
All participants said they combined out data with data from other sources.  We're a part of the puzzle that they individually put together. 

## External participants that we make our data open and available to the public.
They believe that open data leads to trust in government.

## Users like data in table format.
4 participants (including both external) said they wanted a way to view a table of the data that they could manipulate without having to download.  They also wanted to be able to filter the data on the site to get to the numbers they need.
## The narrative gets in the way of quickly finding numbers.
4 participants (including both external) said that the narrative gets in the way of finding numbers.  We should explore ways to more quickly get to numbers that bypasses the narrative.  We also need to talk with more users who fall into the Domain Learner type that would benefit from the narrative.

# Next Steps
* Conduct design studio to come up with ideas for disbursements (done).
* Journey map internal processes and how they impact users to see if we can better understand the current state and make improvements.
* Learn about the value of the narrative from user types who are likely to benefit from it.
