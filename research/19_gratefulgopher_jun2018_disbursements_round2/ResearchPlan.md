# Background
We have revised the disbursements prototypes from the last round of user research and updated them with as close to the actual data as possible.  We want to evaluate the updated designs with users.  A secondary goal is to flesh out our defined user types more by asking users about how they use the site.
# Goals and questions
* Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
  - Can they find the data they want using the prototypes?
  - Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  - Which approach works best?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  - Where does the site fit into the user’s flow of work?
# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we’d like to speak with 5-9 individuals from several of the following user groups for 50-minute remote 1:1 interviews.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
# Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who have previously been identified as potential participants.
