## Methods

* Notes, no recording
* Remote or in person

## Script
Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the purpose of today's session: "My goal today is to get feedback on a few words and phrases we are considering for our website. I really appreciate your taking the time to talk today – your feedback will help us make this site more accessible and easier to use."

Consent: "All feedback is anonymous." (Provide them with contact info and let them know that they should feel free to contact you with any questions, comments, or concerns they might have after the test is over.)

Test details: "This interview will be really brief – it should only take between five and ten minutes. I'll ask a few broad questions first. Then, I’ll show you a few words and phrases and ask a few follow up questions. I encourage you to share any other feedback you have at any point during the interview – all feedback is valuable to us."

"Do you have any questions? If not, feel free to ask questions throughout the process."

"Okay, let's get started. As an introduction, what's your occupation?"

"Awesome – thanks for sharing this information. We’re going to move onto the next part of the interview now. This section is focused on the front page of the website we’re renovating. We're still working on the site, so it is more like a Powerpoint online than a real website. Not all of it is interactive but you can explore a bit if you like. I'll then ask you to answer some questions."

Show each person one homepage option at a time, asking them to think out loud about their impressions and expectations. Probe with the following questions (most important ones are bold):
- **What do you think this site is about?**
- **What information might you find in this website?**
- What questions do you have about this site?
- Tell me your first impression.
- How do you interpret that?
- Anything else you associate with these words?

Repeat with each of the homepage options. Change the order for each test.

## Test asset(s)
The homepage mock ups with test names are in [Issue #2384](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/2384).
