# Sprint-ElegantEchidna research plan

## Goals & questions

Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate prototype state pages | Do people find state pages interesting?
 | Do people understand key concepts (like federal revenue) more quickly in this context?
 | Do people understand what data they're seeing on the state pages?
 | Can people find data that's relevant to their area (region or county)?
 | Do people understand the direction money is moving? Who is making the money-- 'revenue' to company or government.


## Background

Over the past few sprints, we've created state profile pages, which hopefully address some of the big issues raised by earlier research, including...

* [Confusion about revenues](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/1260)
* [Desire for more local stories/data](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/08_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#how-do-journalists-decide-if-something-is-interesting-and-worth-writing-about)
* [Preferences for consolidated information about single states](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/08_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#how-do-people-want-to-use-our-data-what-were-they-trying-to-do-and-what-did-they-expect)
* [The general need for data and context to be pulled together across the site](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/08_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#linking-related-information-and-data-across-the-site)

These pages are still in prototype form, but it's time to evaluate whether they make sense to users and begin to address some of our earlier issues.

## Methods

* 30 min interviews with contacts from the webinar
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote
