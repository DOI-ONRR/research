# Sprint-ElegantEchidna interview script

## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time."

"Please remember when I say 'test' I mean I'm testing our website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!"


## Main questions

_Show or send the participant the latest prototype state page for the state the user lives in. Either give them mouse control or confirm they've reached the page._

"I’ve got a sample page from our site here. This page isn't online yet, and is still in draft form."

[NEED MORE INTRO TO THE SITE BEFORE DROPPING THEM INTO STATE PAGES?]

"Imagine somebody sent you a link to this page and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. I'd like to ask you some questions about what you see here and how you might navigate this page. If you could, please talk out loud as you explore and walk me through what you're thinking. This will help us understand how to improve things later."
