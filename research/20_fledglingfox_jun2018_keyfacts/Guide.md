# Interview Guide

## Intro (5 min)
### Introductions
Welcome, thank you for taking the time to meet with us.  I’m here today along with a few people from my team who are taking notes.  
What we do on this team is talk with people about their tasks and observe them completing tasks, to learn about improvements we can make to the site.  Have you ever participated in research like this before?
### Consent (external participants only)
I have a form for you to digitally sign giving us permission to conduct the study. It just states your rights as a participant and that we won't be capturing any personally identifiable information 
* Consent form: [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenUo9tqJx7vCoM0egah927IkJO5WEQIEBckXgrOaGOxUjLqg/viewform)
* What the consent for is about (if the participant has any questions):
  - This consent form relates to interviews conducted by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.
  - By submitting this form you are indicating that you have read the description of the study and that you agree to the terms as described.  
## User Task Background (20 min)
* Have you used the Natural Resources Revenue portal before?
  - Tell me a little bit about what you use the Portal for.
* What is your overall process when you are using natural resource data?
* What are your goals?
* What do you want people to know?
* How do you know what data or numbers you need for your work?
* How do you know where to look?
* How do you verify the data you are going to use?
## Task Setup (1 min)
* We’re going to be looking at some prototypes of designs we’re thinking about.
* About testing designs with a prototype.  
  - Because it’s a prototype, not everything will be clickable.  It’s only built to complete a few tasks to get a feel for how the design would work.
  - We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
  - I’d like you to think out loud 
  - I want to know what you really think and how you would actually use it.  You can’t hurt my feelings. We want honest feedback so we can make the designs better. 


## Task & Questions (30 min)
Prototype: https://vavl06.axshare.com/#g=1&p=start_1

### Home Page Key Facts
Imagine you’re new to natural resource revenue data.  Take a look at this page and tell me what you can do.
* Alternate options between participants.
* Looking at key facts section:
  - What do you think of this section?
  - Does it tell you information that is useful to you?
  - Is there any information that isn’t useful?
  - What’s missing?
* Switch to other Key Facts concepts and ask same questions.
* Which of these options do you like better?
### Disbursements
Imagine you’re interested in data (writing a story, producing a report, etc. - based on the user’s actual tasks) about oil production from offshore of Texas that is part of the the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA), which entitles Texas (and other Gulf states) to a share of revenue coming from offshore sources in the Gulf of Mexico and you need numbers around how that money is being used.
* Start on Explore Data page in prototype.
* Once starts completing the task:
  - How do you get to the numbers?
  - What do you do with the numbers to put them in her story?
  - Would you want to compare it against any other numbers?
  - Prompt around the term “disbursements” if she doesn’t get there on her own.
  - What would you do if you wanted to compare the amount that Texas is getting with the amount Louisiana is getting?
*If don’t get to table view or state page, have them go there.
### Social Media
Now, imagine you saw this image on Twitter.  
* What would you expect it to link to?  
* Thoughts? 
* Repeat with other social options.


## Close (2 min)
* Are you interested in participating in future studies? Do you have any other specific areas of the site (or data elements) that you’re interested in providing your feedback on?
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with to get more insight on disbursements data?
* Thank you for your time. Your insights have been helpful to us in understanding how we might improve processes around sharing disbursements data. If there is additional information that comes to mind that you think might be helpful please feel free to reach out to myself via email.
