# Lease Level Data
* The geographic component is important and users want to see that at both the state page level and drilling up from a well or lease
* One example of a use case is being able to look at the counties with the highest production and seeing what is going on my looking at the disposition
* Even users who know a lot about leases may not know what things like tubing string, completion code, gas plant, API gravity, or BTUs are, but they still want as much data available as possible
* Users want to be able to download all the data for a particular county or state, not just a given lease or well or operator
* Users want the mixed leases included and to have the federal portion broken out.  Without that, they would have to do a FOIA request.

# Filterable tables
## General
* Most participants didn't have a use for sparklines, but a couple thought it was nice to see the trend.
* Most participants understood how the horizontal scroll arrows work
* Participants liked being able to pick what to download
* People are still confused by “source” label
* People are confused by “organize by”, particularly when paired with “sort by” in the production table
* Most people understand how the drilling down functionality works

## Production
* Users like being able to drill down to operators
* There was some confusion between commodity and product
* Didn’t know which filter or toggle was selected (SM: I darkened the selected color after this. We also saw this issue in previous testing with toggles.)

## Revenue
### Option 1
* Overwhelmed by the amount of information
* Liked that it puts a lot of data in a small space

### Option 2
* All 3 participants chose this as their preferred option
* Like that it lets you pick what you want to see
* One participant (familiar with the data) would want source to be there by default for revenue

# Sales data (one participant)
* Thinks sales data should be its own section
* Uses sales data to figure out what percentage tax payers recoup

# Current site
## Map
* Both general public users went straight for the map
* One noted that it doesn’t have enough contrast
* One noted that the offshore regions made it difficult to read the map

## Data summary
* Didn’t understand fiscal and calendar year when interacting with the key stats
* Expected disbursements to have a monthly toggle like revenue
* Liked the Native American breakout on the homepage because that’s an area she’s interested in.
* Liked being able to sort of tie the graphs together and see that the decline in coal didn’t impact disbursements.
* Didn’t get that the numbers changed when she clicked on the homepage.  That could be because it was the number that showed by default and it didn’t actually change when she clicked on it.

## Explore Data
* Thought the map at the top of the Explore Data page meant she was in the same place she was before.  Was overwhelmed by Explore Data and just stuck to the map.
* Curious about download button - expected it to be a table with all the numbers
* Didn’t get that the numbers on the bar graphs are years

## State pages
* Wanted to click on the map at the top of the state page to get county.
* Thought AZ was cleaner than CO state page (even though they use the same template)
* Encountered some known bugs on the CO page with the useless drop-down and maps that show withheld. (#2604 and #3272)
* Didn’t seem particularly interested in digging into county data.

## Navigation
* Never noticed the right nav even when prompted to click on it
* Doesn’t like to scroll.

## Glossary
* Wanted a lot of definitions for things like MCF, royalties, onshore/offshore, other biomass
* Confused by the book and question mark.  Didn’t click on the book in context. Said she saw it, but also didn’t see the question mark.  She may have been primed to look for the book and the sketchiness may have contributed to not seeing the question mark.

## How It Works
* Didn’t like the title of How It Works.  Thinks that would be how to do something, not how to learn something.
* Thought the diving graphic was helpful
