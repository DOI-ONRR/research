# Sprint-SplashySunfish interview script


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. This isn't a test to see how much you know, and there are no right or wrong answers. We're designing a website that hopes to help people understand how mineral mining and oil and gas production works in the U.S. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take about 15 to 30 minutes of your time."


## Question outline

1. Say a friend sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up when you clicked on the link.
1. What do you think this site is for?
1. [Guide people to reconciliation page] What do you think this page is about? What do you think it tells you?
1. [If relevant] Say you know that there is more information and data on this site about your state. Where would you go?
