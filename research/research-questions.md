*This is a place to dump research questions and notes — see specific research sprints for more refined research plans.*

**Who, exactly, are our intended — or at least likely — users, and how do they describe themselves?**

*People who care about the extractives industry* is a broad enough grouping that they probably don't think of themselves in those terms. They might identify as:

- researchers
- activists
- lobbyists
- policymakers
- journalists
- voters (?)

**What do we want people to learn from the site?**
