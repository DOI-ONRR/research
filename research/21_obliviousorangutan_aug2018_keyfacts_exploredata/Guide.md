### Introductions
Welcome, thank you for taking the time to meet with us.  I’m here today along with a few people from my team who are taking notes.

## About Testing Prototypes
* We’re going to be looking at some prototypes of designs we’re thinking about.
* Not everything will be clickable.  
* We’re testing the design we’re not testing you.
* I’d like you to think out loud
* I want to know what you really think and how you would actually use it.  You can’t hurt my feelings. We want honest feedback so we can make the designs better.
