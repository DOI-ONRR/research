# Background

Given that the purpose and content of the Natural Resources Revenue Data site is no longer going to be driven by the EITI, the ONRR team has an opportunity to revisit the purpose and goals of the site. We’d like to ground this potential shift in product strategy in a clear understanding of the needs of the site’s intended users.

# Goals and questions
| Goals | Questions |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Learn more about the needs of our target users related to natural resources revenue data. | What kind of information do our target users need related to natural resources revenue data? |
| | What do they use it for? |
| | How do they get this info currently? |
| | How would they they prefer to get this info it in the future? |


# Methods and desired participants

Over the course of several weeks, we’d like to speak with 5-8 individuals from several of the following user groups for 50-minute remote or in-person 1:1 interviews.

- **Journalists:** We hypothesize that these folks need resources revenue data to use as source material for related stories.
- **Researchers or other data users:** We hypothesize that academics and researchers need resources revenue data to inform their work.
- **Citizens, advocates, and NGOs:** We hypothesize that resources revenue data can support these folks in their advocacy work.
- **Policymakers (federal, state, local & tribal):** We hypothesize that these folks need resources revenue data to make more informed policy decisions.

# Recruitment strategy

In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups (both for this research sprint as well as to begin developing a recruitment pipeline for future research sprints), we’re currently planning to pursue three avenues:

1. **Contacting members of the Royalty Policy Committee** to ask for their help putting us in touch with members of their organizations who use natural resource revenue data in their day to day work.
2. **Reaching out to various related interest groups whom Ryan has identified.**
3. **Setting up a recruiting screener on the site itself,** as well as other related sites that ONRR owns as appropriate/possible.
