# Sprint-PocketMouse research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate global navigation | Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation?
 | What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms?
Evaluate glossary indicator | Do people understand what the glossary icon means?
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

We are continuing to fine-tune the global navigation micro-copy on our site beased on the results from Sprint-MightyMoose research. Changes in this testing round include:

1. Changing 'local impact' to 'case studies' to more accurately reflect what's found under that link. Previously, people expected a much more robust set of content than we have for the December version of the site.

1. Pulling 'utility'-type links into a separate global navigation chunk. This includes 'downloads', 'glossary', and search.

1. Creating two options for the glossary icon to test. The icon itself is no longer in a tab on the upper right. It is instead used throughout the site to indicate when there is a word that is defined in the glossary, and when clicked will open the glossary drawer.

1. Adding a 'Learn more about USEITI' text link to the intro block.

More information on the proposed information architecture writ large is [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/622).


### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what they'll find when they click on words in the global navigation
* Whether participants understand that click on an underlined word with a book icon means that we have a glossary of extraction terms that they can access.
* Whether participants understand what the USEITI is


## Methods
* 10 min interviews with people unfamiliar with USEITI
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote


## Script

Script available [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/05_sprint-pocketmouse/sprint-pocketmouse_interview-script.md).


## Test asset(s)

We have two versions of this test, one with a simpler glossary icon (open book) and one with a slightly more complex icon (open book with bookmark). We will start testing with the simpler icon, but if that is not clear, move to the more complex icon.
