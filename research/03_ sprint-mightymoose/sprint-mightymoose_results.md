# Information architecture usability test results


## Hypotheses tested

- Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation? KINDA!
- What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms? (see below)
- Do people understand what the site is about? CLOSER!
- We've starting moving towards global nav as categories throughout the site. Is this making the information structure clearer? TENTATIVE YES!
- What problems are most severe? (see below)


## Participants

- 8 people unfamiliar with USEITI in the following locations: Minneapolis, MN; Lawrence, KS; Washington, DC; St Germain, WI; San Francisco, CA.


## Let's talk about that global navigation

The focus of this test was the global navigation, and by proxy, the information architecture of the site. We tested a navigation with five options: home, natural resources, explore data, local impact, and downloads.

### Natural Resources

- People were evenly split on whether this term made sense or was confusing. The biggest problem is that is vague enough to be easily confused with the following section name, Explore Data. When people understood the term, they expected to find in-depth information on different resources.

- _Um. Yeah. Actually, it’s a little confusing. Next to ‘explore data’ it’s confusing because I think the whole site is about exploring data, so what’s under natural resources?_

- _I would expect to find out what extractive industries represent in terms of oil, gas, renewables with more specificity that that laundry list that’s on the front page._

### Explore Data

- The term Explore Data was fairly clear. People expected data, and generally expected some sort of ability to interact with data and drill in. However, there was some confusion about potential overlap with the previous category, Natural Resources.

- _This is much more clear. I assume some fancy way to explore what data there is._

- _This maybe has a dashboard, maybe some numbers, charts, maps._

- _Natural Resources and Explore Data are confusing. What should I click on? Isn’t it all natural resources?_

### Local Impact

- People expected local engagement in this section, either through the ability to see information (narrative and data) by state or local area, or through ways to contact governments or organizations to get involved.

- _[You would click here] if you want to know personally how this will impact you. Kinda like how this will impact myself, how I can get involved._

- _This looks like public sector for me. What the public would want. Maybe just articles or information that drills down into all this data and what it means for the local population._

- _This is interesting. Moves beyond [data]. Maybe stats for county. More research. ... This is good because it probably has more qualitative info, paths to engage, options._

### Downloads

- People were in general confused about this term. Many people were able to guess what would be here, but it causes a pause.

- _GIS maps? Maybe ways to download data._

- _If I was doing research and I wanted data for myself I could go here._

- _If I just want to csv or something of all this stuff. Maybe papers that have been written somewhere and available here._


## How about that global nav as categories throughout the site? Is this making the information structure clearer?

This gets a tentative yes. Some participants picked up on the repetition of themes. Participants also noted that while the global nav on the upper right wasn't particularly noticable, they were able to navigate the site because of other features (which, as it happens, related to our repetition). However, this can't be confirmed until we get more content into the site and let people explore.


## General feedback

Overall, we are ever-closer to a first-glance understanding of what the site is for.

- _[This is a site] with information about natural resources like oil/gas/coal publicly available._

- _[This is a site about] how much is in different industries and how it is managed._

We still see skepticism around the initiative.

- _Was it all secret [before]? Who is forcing them to make it public?_

- _Why does the government need to know this information? How is it being used?_

And some confusion about what to do on the site.

- _How am I engaging with this other than it is cool?_

- _Helps industry accountability. Generally unclear [what the site is for] other than keeping them accountable._


### What problems were most severe?

The biggest problem is the confusion between the terms 'Natural Resources' and 'Explore Data' in the global navigation because changes to resolve overlap could affect site information architecture. We are proposing a name change to 'Natural Resources' as this was the term causing the problem (people did, in general, understand 'Explore Data'). The team discussed other terms, and will be testing 'How it works' instead of 'Natural Resources'.

'Local Impact' and 'Downloads,' while unclear in certain ways, are less risky to leave as-is for now because their problems so not indicate essential issues for site architecture. As the content of the site fills out, we will revisit those terms and test on a more full-formed site.

The skepticism about the overall site purpose remind us to provide a more obvious link to the USEITI process. We are considering an in-text link in the intro block and other solutions. As for the confusion about what to do on the site, we will re-test this on a more fully-formed site.
