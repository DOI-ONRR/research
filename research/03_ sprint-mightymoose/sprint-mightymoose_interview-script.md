# Information architecture user interview questions, Sprint Mighty Moose


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 5 minutes of your time."


## Main questions

_Show the in-person participant the latest version of the site and give them computer control, or ask the remote participant to click on the InVision link to the 'live' mock and share their screen._

"I’ve got a sample page from our new site here. This is just a picture of what it will look like, it's not clickable."

"Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. I'd like to ask you some general questions about what you see here. If you could, please talk out loud as you explore and walk me through what you're thinking. This will help us understand how to improve things later."

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?"

2. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"

3. _Draw the participant's attention to the global nav_ "Can you tell me what you think you'll see when you click on [nav item]?" _Ask this question for all nav items except HOME._

4. "What questions does this site leave you with? Can you walk me through things you think are confusing?"


## Wrap up

"Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future usability tests of our work, please feel free to email me [provide contact info]. Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!"
